### Hi there, I'm Akash. 👋

I'm a Data Scientist Practitioner, Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher who likes to solve business problems. I've keen interest in client handling, business improvement, and statistics. I used to work with issues related to predictive modelling, personalization and recommendation systems. I have vast knowledge of machine learning algorithms which helps me choose the best approach. Apart from that, I enjoy travelling, meeting new people, cooking food, and I am a trained flute player. 

## 🔭 My current working are ...

[**Easy Dash**](https://easydashnew.herokuapp.com/) - A dashboard to visualize the dataset (like patient-ventilator control data) and create ANN and IANN models using different types of optimizers like PSO, SGD, ADAM.


_Tech Stack:_ Tensorflow, Python Dash, Flask, Pytorch, Heroku, AWS. 

[**COVAT**](https://github.com/ascoolakash/covat) - The main objective of our COVAT project is to come up with a knowledge graph for tracking the covid-19 vaccine update. These updates can help researchers with a better understanding of effective cataloging of various in trial vaccines and their related use of launched vaccines. Knowledge graph created by extracting data from the U.S. Nation Library of Medicine.
