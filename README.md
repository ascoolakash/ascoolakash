### Hi there, I'm Akash. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist Practioner, Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher who likes to work on personalize buisness domian problem. I've keen interest in client handling, business improvement, and statistics. I used to work with problems related to predictive modeling, personalization and recommendation systems. I have vast knowledge of machine learning algorithms which helps me choose the best approach. Apart from that, I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, cooking food, and trained flute player. 

## ðŸ”­ My current working are ...
